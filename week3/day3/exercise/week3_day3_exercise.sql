--Exercise 2:
UPDATE film
SET language_id = 2
WHERE film_id IN (1, 2, 3);  -- Assuming these IDs correspond to films you want to update

-- In the customer table, there are two important connections:
-- address_id: This links to the address table.
-- store_id: This links to the store table.
-- These connections make sure that the data stays accurate. When you add a new customer, you have to make sure that the address_id and store_id match with existing entries in the address and store tables. If you try to add a customer with an address_id or store_id that doesn't exist, it wonâ€™t work.
